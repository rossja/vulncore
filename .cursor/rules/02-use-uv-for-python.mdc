# Use UV for package and project management

1. Use uv for package dependancies and project management.
2. Do not use a requirements.txt file, only use pyproject.toml.
3. Ensure that packages used in the source code are properly listed in the pyproject.toml.
4. Make sure we are using venv for the proper python interpretor.
5. take advantage of modern features offered by uv, such as using `uv sync`.
6. Use `uv run` to execute python modules.
